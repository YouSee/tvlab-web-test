# TV labs web test

## Task

Your task is to implement the navigation as displayed in the `Design` folder. It is a responsive design and the main focus of this task is implementing the correct layout and structure of the design. The exact colors and fonts are not essential to complete the task.

The solution has to be completed as a pull towards towards this repository.

## Structure

The application is based on the `create-react-app` base (https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html), so there should be no need to modify any build settings (though you are welcome to, if desired). All source code is located in `src` and the necessary assets are located in `src/assets`.

The current structure is meant to assist in being able to focus solely on the implementation of the design and it is advised to not change it in the interest of time.

## Notes

Should you feel the need to provide extra information other than source code, you can create a new file called `notes.txt` in the root of the respository and add the information there.

## Requirements

1. The implementation must be done with Typescript (http://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. The styling must be carried out using styled-components (https://styled-components.com/)
3. The solution must work in version 80 of `Chrome` (https://www.google.com/chrome/)
4. The solution must be submitted as a pull request towards `master` at https://github.com/YouSee/tvlab-web-test
5. (Optional) Notes must be added to `notes.txt` in the root

Enjoy! ðŸ¦„
